#FrontEnd Specialization Task Manager


Description:

---

I have built a Task Management App using React, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and Auth0 authentication. The app allows users to register, log in, and manage tasks securely. 
Key features include:  

- Authentication: Users authenticate via Auth0 with login, logout, and protected routes.  
- Task Management: Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks stored in local storage.  
- Navigation & Routing: Implemented with React Router for seamless page transitions.  
- UI Design: Bootstrap components ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.  

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party authentication, manage state, and build a functional full-stack-like application.
